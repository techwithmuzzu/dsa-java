# 🧠 Data Structures in Java  

This repository is dedicated to my **daily problem-solving journey** in Java.  
The goal is to **improve my logical thinking, problem-solving ability, and deep understanding of core Data Structures and Algorithms** — from first principles to advanced concepts.

## 📘 What this repository contains  

Each Java file includes:
- 🔗 **Problem Link** – Direct reference to the original problem (LeetCode, GFG, etc.)  
- 🧩 **Problem Statement** – Short description of what needs to be solved  
- 💡 **Approaches** – Step-by-step evolution of the solution:
  1. **Brute Force Solution** – Initial, straightforward method  
  2. **Average / Improved Solution** – Optimized with better logic or data structure  
  3. **Best Possible Solution** – Final efficient approach with reasoning  
- ⏱️ **Time & Space Complexity** – For each approach  
- 🧠 **Thought Process** – Explaining how the logic evolved from basic to optimal
